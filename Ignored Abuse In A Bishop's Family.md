**Subject:** **Ignored Abuse In A Bishop's Family.**

Hello all. First I wanna thank the few people who responded to my mother's letter to the Diocese of Rochester describing her pain. And who have reached out to us to show their support. You are reminders that there are decent individuals in the church. 

 I have previously sent a letter describing in detail the abuse I had to deal with in my house from Prince Singh. My father, who twisted the narrative of his divorce with my mother. He said it was her choice. That is a lie. He stated that he wanted to divorce her and she agreed. Then he sent a letter to the Diocese in 2021 completely ignoring the feelings of my mother, my brother and I. In turn the entire church neglected my family. They chose only to believe my father's side of the story. Whether they were aware of that or not.

 He lied about the divorce being amicable between all parties. Time and time again I have had to deal with a false narrative. Attached are letters written by my brother and I that have been seen by Bishop Curry back in December 2022. He wrote back saying that he would confer with Bishop Todd Ousley and get back to us and our mother. He never did. He knew about the abuse we had dealt with and still did nothing. Now he has given my father permission and his blessing to remarry his ex lover. Also he has doubled his salary. What this means is the Episcopal Church protected an abusive alcoholic. 

 This is an example of patriarchal oppression and negligence. I am disgusted that the truth of my family is continuing to be ignored. There was a time when I loved my dad. Now the pervasive fabrications have become more important. They have been geared towards cutting out my voice and the voices of my mother and brother. This has given me no other option but to leave my story amongst the ether. Please note these letters contain tellings of domestic abuse. And please take this truth and do what is necessary. Whatever that means to you.
