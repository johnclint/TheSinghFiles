Dear Leaders of the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester that “Welcomes all” as “God’s beloved,”

After much pain and reflection, I am writing as an injured woman, mother and former Bishop Spouse of The Episcopal Diocese of Rochester in the hope that recent oversights and errors will not be visited on clergy and Bishop families in the future. This email is not about money, retribution or any other cause except that this Church realizes the deep harm done to me and to my sons by the assumption that a Bishop’s word should not be questioned, or even explored.

To my surprise, not only the Standing Committee, but leaders in the entire Diocese, the Presiding Bishop, the House of Bishops, clergy outside this Diocese and most of our common friends received a letter from Bishop Singh announcing the end of our marriage and reporting that I was the initiator of that. In my opinion, in so doing the Bishop made unilateral use of his position and power to intentionally preserve his image at the cost of my reputation – and the truth. Today, I clearly see why.  

You may wonder why I did not contact the Standing Committee or the Presiding Bishop at the time.  First, contrary to that letter, I had always truly hoped that our marriage could be saved, and our family preserved.  I felt that publicly contradicting Bishop Singh at that time would have put an end to that hope.  Even though I saw drafts, I was pressured for the letter to go out soon and it was not until the letter went out, and I heard comments from others including a Bishop spouse, that I actually saw and felt the impact and deliberate attempt to hide the truth.  Untrue words that I requested to be removed, stayed. I was devastated by the tone of finality in the letter and was saddened that the family therapy sessions with our sons, and all my contact with Bishop Singh except that of a legal nature, ended with this letter.  

What came next, however, crushed my soul.  I did not receive a call or even a note from my parish pastor or from any members of my parish except a couple (who are close to our sons) enquiring after my well-being, much less the veracity of the statements in the Bishop’s letter. After twelve years of my service to this Diocese, much of it heavy, hands-on work, continuous hospitality and teaching at many other parishes where I truly believed I had built friendships and community, I heard nothing from any of those members.  However, one kind soul reached out to me, who, after six months, explained that the closing of the Bishop’s letter in which he asked for “space” for each of us, kept her from doing it sooner.  Two priests who had an estranged relationship with Bishop Singh texted me and I did not want to encourage that at that point. That impact of that sentence about “space” came as a shock to me when it was published as I needed support, not silence, at the time, but for the above reason, I had kept quiet. I expended all my energy in church friendships. Thankfully I have a profession and few friends of my own in Rochester. Rev. Cameron Miller’s attachment to that letter was another shocker in speaking for me without even talking with me and took the liberty used the term “impending divorce” totally misrepresenting me and my desires, as I never once said that to anyone.    

Most devastatingly, I did not hear a word from the Presiding Bishop, with whom my sons and I had enjoyed a close pastoral and friendly relationship. Only recently did I feel strong enough to email him to ask why.  He replied that he was given to understand that I did not wish to hear from him!  That is, he believed the Bishop so completely, so utterly, that our years of pastoral care and friendship were immediately erased.  I have hope that my family’s relationship with the Presiding Bishop can begin to be mended now that all of us understand the origins of the divide.

Perhaps once I was no longer the Bishop’s wife, I simply became a discarded, insignificant non-entity to the Episcopal church and its priests whom I lovingly embraced. This feeling of rejection hurts so very much, especially as a Dalit woman. For a church community and its priests whom I was close with to treat me in this manner is shattering. Perhaps the colleagues and people I had viewed as friends, having been told by Bishop Singh not to contact me, were fearful. Either way, I was cut adrift from my faith community while my soon-to-be ex-husband continued as Bishop.  When I encountered a church member anywhere in the community, I felt I was being judged based on his unilateral and exclusive channels of communication to those people. Eventually, I avoided everyone but my professional connections.  

Another blow came when my sons and I were not even mentioned at the Bishop’s Farewell Party.  This oversight was acutely felt by our sons.  You will understand that a mother’s pain for her slighted children is worse than she can possibly feel for herself.

This intentional act of leaving us out of the picture hurts because I loved this Diocese, and even more because I am a brown Dalit woman who has been made invisible. I feel cheated by the pretensions of love poured on me when I was a Bishop’s Spouse by the staff and many priests in this diocese who used me for their gains and now, I am a nobody to the Church (except for four kind souls who have genuinely reached out). The fact that of the 10,000 or more people in this Diocese, not a single person was disturbed by this deletion is very telling.

As priests and leaders in the church who stand for truth, please share my hurt and concerns with your vestry, wardens and parishioners who have been misled. You have my permission to be responsible. My sons and I may be lost to the Episcopal Church; only time will tell.  Aren’t we “God’s beloved” as well? Or is that exclusionary? However, this shunning of a mother and sons based on unquestioningly accepting a narrative that came from a position of power never should have happened, and I write now in the hope that it may never happen again to anyone. 

 Sincerely, 

Roja Singh
